# Non-Linear-Spectral-Unmixing
Land use and land cover classification is typically performed in an absolute manner, where each pixel is assigned a single land cover class as a category. However, in reality, land cover boundaries are rarely discrete or perfectly square-shaped. Understanding the fractional composition of different land cover types within a pixel is crucial for more accurate and meaningful analysis. 

This repository provides code for performing spectral unmixing to estimate the fractional abundance of each land cover class within a pixel. It also quantifies the uncertainty associated with these estimates using an ensemble of random forest classifiers.
